The code (the work) that is created for the Dutch Corona app is available under 
the EUPL/1.2 license; and any outside contributions to it are under an individual 
Committer License Agreement (iCLA) that references this license explicitly. 

However - that does not mean that all (derived) work is solely under that single license. 

For example - where appropriate certain (open source) modules may be required and 
included in the Corona App. These will remain under their original Copyright and 
License (though some of the Corona App specific changes may released under 
the be EUPL/1.2 if they are unsuitable to be contributed back upstream).

Secondly - it is a general policy of the ‘Rijksoverheid’  to release its websites 
and documents under the CC0 license provided that any further use or citations 
do not infringe or suggest that an endorsement or similar from the Government 
of the Netherlands (https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/copyright). For this purposes, 
documentation of this project is held in the directory ‘documentation’.

Finally - there is a certain set of creative assets; such as the logo of the 
Government of the Netherlands and for example certain fonts which are “for 
official use only”. These files are labeled explicitly as not available 
under a EUPL/1.2 or CC0 license.
